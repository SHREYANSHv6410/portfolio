      <p>
        Hi! I am <strong>Shreyansh</strong> and I am a second year student at
        Manipal Institute of Technology, Bengaluru. I’m someone who loves the
        quiet rhythm of coding and the messy joy of creating art. When I’m not
        building something with lines of code, I’m probably sketching, painting,
        or just sitting outside, letting nature remind me that not everything
        needs to be optimized. I’ve always been drawn to the balance between
        logic and creativity—whether it’s solving a tricky bug or figuring out
        how to make a blank canvas feel less intimidating. And when life gets a
        little too noisy, I find my peace in the simple things: a good cup of
        coffee, the sound of leaves rustling, or the occasional perfectly timed
        sunset. I currently intern at VaultofCodes.
